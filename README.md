# Ship Radar
ONGOING project <br>
This is going to be a website that shows the ships in Saimaa Channel which are going towards to Mustola. Ship data is fetched via REST api and the MQTT Websocket is used to track movements of the ships. I get the ship data from this [open data API](https://www.digitraffic.fi/en/marine-traffic/).

## How to run this
